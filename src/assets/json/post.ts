At the same time, this construction approach ensures the lowering of the entire construction and thus the shutdown of the wave in order to allow the water to flow through the canal as freely as possible when the blackforestwave is idle.\r\nInnovative<\/strong>: The system consists of a steel frame construction with lowerable elements, which is based on a hydraulic system. This enables the wave to be continuously adjusted to different water levels. 10 hydraulic cylinders allow alignment of five individual components, the \"waveshaper\" even enables fine adjustment of the wave during surfing. Everything can be regulated with a self-programmed app.\u00a0The surface of the construction or the ramp, which is necessary for the formation of waves, is clad with wooden planks and screwed to the steel supporting structure.\r\n\r\nhttps:\/\/youtu.be\/iddM61LXU80\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\"Die Pforzheimer Surfwelle \"blackforestwave\" wird vom ehrenamtlichen Verein blackforestwave e.V. geplant, gebaut und betrieben.

Olas says their system can produce high-quality surf by stacking modules. These modules can be customized to fit any desired size or budget of surf park. According to the company, their first pool will hit the two-meter wave height but there are plans to go bigger in the future and produce bigger waves delivered as rights, lefts or both at the same time. The company claims that the cost of their wave pool would be much less than what is currently available on the market.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe park will be built in a nature-surrounded location, very close to Quito, and minutes from the international airport, in a beautiful valley east of the Ecuadorian capital,\u201d the company told us. \u201cThe wave pool will have a capacity of 672 one-hour sessions per day and will be receiving surfers 14 hours every day. It will offer perfect, 1.80m high waves with 16 seconds duration.\u201d\r\n\r\nSource: https:\/\/wavepoolmag.com\/surf-planner-update-the-worlds-latest-wave-pools\/"
