    "waveLocationAbout": " We know that BSR sends through three-wave sets of rights in one direction, then sends through three lefts in the other direction shortly after.   American Wave Machines (AWM) followed a different concept and developed the PerfectSwell, a technology that pumps air into the water.  Their purposely imperfect wave simulates point breaks, beach breaks, and peeling waves that reach between three and eight feet.  The first public wave pool powered by AWM is the BSR Surf Resort, in Waco, Texas. Each ride lasts between 10 and 15 seconds, but it has been considered the closest experience to an ocean wave.  No plow necessary. Unlike Slater’s pool, which creates its wave by pulling a hydrofoil along the entire length of the pool, the AWM wave is generated using 24 ten-feet-wide air chambers, resulting in 240 feet of wave-generating area. According to Cheyne, they fire the air chambers in unique sequences to produce the different types of waves, of which there are … drum roll ... infinite!  They can create new waves, pretty much whenever. Because of the air chamber tech, AWM pools can theoretically produce an infinite amount of wave-types. By pumping energy from different chambers at different times/speed/intensity/order/duration/etc., they can push water in all sorts of weird and wonderful directions, creating points, slabs, air sections and so forth.  Nearly six months after voluntarily closing its doors, the surf pool powered by American Wave Machines is back in business at Waco, Texas.  Hailed as one of the best artificial wave pool concepts ever created, the BSR Surf Resort made its public debut in early June 2018 and was a hit within the surfing community.  Everyone who surfed it said they had the closest experience possible to riding an ocean wave in an inland environment.  BSR Surf Resort's second life comes with a new wave riding experience. It is called \"Freak Peak,\" a powerful wedge that will keep advanced surfers entertained for hours.  American Wave Machines has also taken time to fine-tune Perfect Swell, the software that interacts with the hardware to produce waves.  Now, there are up to 40 different types of waves that can be pumped into the pool. In production are three: advanced, intermediate and beginner.  Boards are include in price for beginners. Boards can be rented They offer a: add promo or discount code. Maybe this code can be derived via waves.guide? ",

And the only wavepool deemed worthy of a CT event. (This Friday and Saturday.) We haven't surfed this wave ourselves, yet. but the waves are tricky, fluctuate slightly from one to the next and are extremely powerful. The waves are not all identical so some will close out and run away from you. Despite the YouTube clips we see of perfect, peeling Kelly’s, it’s still a challenge to be in the right place. It’s hard to read. You can’t read it the same as you do an ocean wave where you pick up peripheral signals around you. The Kelly’s wave just pops up in front of you. So it’s trippy, you paddle before you even see a wave or anything.\nSource: https://wavepoolmag.com/kelly-slater-wave-pool-versus-bsr-surf-resort/",

Water To keep the >22 million liter water crystal clear and hygienically safe, each Wavegarden Cove is supplied with its own state-of-the-art water treatment system. Developed in-house, the system is based on a series of sustainable treatments, including fine filtration, ozone and UV disinfection, and low chemical chlorination.  Energy The mechanical system employed by the Wavegarden Cove consumes less than 1Khw per wave - very little energy is lost in the transmission of forces, and even part of the power is recovered and reused. Odriozola says that comparability studies reveal that Wavegarden's technology uses ten times less energy than other pneumatic wave generation systems today. Based on average electricity prices, this can translate into savings of more than one million euros per year. And based on 1000 waves per hour this still comes down to: 1 MWh (megawatt hour), whereas SurfLoch uses 5 MWh  and Langenfeld 350KWh  Modules/Pumps The machinery is modular, and the length of waves depends on the number of modules installed. A standard-sized facility like UrbnSurf Melbourne has 46 modules and offers rides around 16 seconds long, comparable to some of the best surf spots in the world. The new facility being constructed in Siheung, South Korea - and scheduled to open in September 2020 - will have 56 modules. Large scale facilities are ideal if the space is available. However, it is also possible to create high-quality waves with fewer modules. The Wave Bristol has 40 modules and delivers world-class waves. The Wavegarden Cove demo center has 28 modules and has been widely acclaimed by elite professionals. https://www.surfertoday.com/surfing/wavegarden-aims-to-lead-the-wave-pool-industry",

Sustainability @The Wave - https://vimeo.com/66650028 - The assumption is valid as long as the wave pool is located at least a quarter of an hour nearer to his or her home than the chosen beach. - It takes 22 million liter of water to fill the pool.  Water To keep the >22 million liter water crystal clear and hygienically safe, each Wavegarden Cove is supplied with its own state-of-the-art water treatment system. Developed in-house, the system is based on a series of sustainable treatments, including fine filtration, ozone and UV disinfection, and low chemical chlorination.  Energy The mechanical system employed by the Wavegarden Cove consumes less than 1Khw per wave - very little energy is lost in the transmission of forces, and even part of the power is recovered and reused. Odriozola says that comparability studies reveal that Wavegarden's technology uses ten times less energy than other pneumatic wave generation systems today. Based on average electricity prices, this can translate into savings of more than one million euros per year. And based on 1000 waves per hour this still comes down to: 1 MWh (megawatt hour), whereas SurfLoch uses 5 MWh  and Langenfeld 350KWh  Modules/Pumps The machinery is modular, and the length of waves depends on the number of modules installed. A standard-sized facility like UrbnSurf Melbourne has 46 modules and offers rides around 16 seconds long, comparable to some of the best surf spots in the world. The new facility being constructed in Siheung, South Korea - and scheduled to open in September 2020 - will have 56 modules. Large scale facilities are ideal if the space is available. However, it is also possible to create high-quality waves with fewer modules. The Wave Bristol has 40 modules and delivers world-class waves. The Wavegarden Cove demo center has 28 modules and has been widely acclaimed by elite professionals.  Source: https://www.surfertoday.com/",

More than an hour from the ocean but the next best thing, Wave House Santiago included a FlowBarrel left that was “Buena ola”.

Their technology is capable of producing a variety of waves shapes, ride lengths with varying degrees of difficulty that closely mimic natural ocean waves. The Australian-based company developed a technology named 5 Waves that creates concentric waves in a 360-degree pool. 5 Waves produces up to 2,400 waves per hour. The company's concept allows the presence of 200 surfers in the water simultaneously. Surf Lakes is able to offer a variety of waves shapes, ride lengths with varying degrees of difficulty, and eight separate surf breaks. The 5 Waves system pumps waves of up to 7.8 feet in all directions and over multiple breaks. Surf Lakes believes that wind direction can be used to advantage, whichever direction it blows. The technology requires a minimum lake size of 2.5 hectares, plus surrounding shoreline.

Krefeld City and German developers, the Elakari Group, are working hard to bring the 25m€ Surf Park to fruition in time for summer 2023.   Estimated to attract over 200k visitors to the Rhine-Ruhr region each year, our surfing lagoon will be placed at the heart of the project, which is themed on sports, leisure, wellness, camping and gastronomy.   “Surfing is becoming increasingly popular across Germany even though we have very few spots to practice\", said Elakari’s Managing Director, Andreas Niedergesäss. Wavegarden´s co-founder, Karin Frisch, a German native, is equally delighted to know that her compatriots will have greater access to quality waves. \"German surfers won´t need to travel as far to go surfing. Krefeld will have its own perfect surf beach with consistent, ocean-like waves suitable for all ages and performance levels”.",

Developed in-house, the system is based on a series of sustainable treatments, including fine filtration, ozone and UV disinfection, and low chemical chlorination.  Energy The mechanical system employed by the Wavegarden Cove consumes less than 1Khw per wave - very little energy is lost in the transmission of forces, and even part of the power is recovered and reused. Odriozola says that comparability studies reveal that Wavegarden's technology uses ten times less energy than other pneumatic wave generation systems today. Based on average electricity prices, this can translate into savings of more than one million euros per year. And based on 1000 waves per hour this still comes down to: 1 MWh (megawatt hour), whereas SurfLoch uses 5 MWh  and Langenfeld 350KWh  Modules/Pumps The machinery is modular, and the length of waves depends on the number of modules installed. A standard-sized facility like UrbnSurf Melbourne has 46 modules and offers rides around 16 seconds long, comparable to some of the best surf spots in the world. The new facility being constructed in Siheung, South Korea - and scheduled to open in September 2020 - will have 56 modules. Large scale facilities are ideal if the space is available. However, it is also possible to create high-quality waves with fewer modules. The Wave Bristol has 40 modules and delivers world-class waves. The Wavegarden Cove demo center has 28 modules and has been widely acclaimed by elite professionals. https://www.surfertoday.com/surfing/wavegarden-aims-to-lead-the-wave-pool-industry ",

Therefore it is advised  to take a board at least 3 (for big boys 5) liter bigger then the board you use in salt water.  And don’t worry, you will get at least 12 waves in every 55 minute session. This is a given cos of the max amount op people they let in the wave.  Also, peddle out using the channel, if possible. You will be thanking yourself taking of at the last waves of your session(s) ;-)  Bring your winter Neo! (or hire) The water is not  HEATED which is better for our planet and to reduce costs. The pool is not INDOOR, which is better for the view on the mountains and to enjoy the sun in the summer.   It is also very much fun for kids. Kids need to be >120cm in LENGTH and >8 years old.  Access to Pro and Beast sessions only after 2 Expert sessions without being taken out of the water by a surfcoach employee.  5 waves pack: 517 euro  Surfboard: 20 euro for the BASIC polyester boards, 40 euro for PREMIUM boards. Test the latest boards on the market shaped by the biggest brands * Not available for Sessions Pro & Beast.  Energy consumption: 1Kwh per wave (which will break at both sides: L and R). And 12 waves per customer, independent of the session.  We learned that Alaia bay stores their webcamfootage per session for four days. With that everyone can look back at their session using Surfline.com. Very unclear though … Better: have a friend film you with your handy!

Olas says their system can produce high-quality surf by stacking modules. These modules can be customized to fit any desired size or budget of surf park. According to the company, their first pool will hit the two-meter wave height but there are plans to go bigger in the future and produce bigger waves delivered as rights, lefts or both at the same time. The company claims that the cost of their wave pool would be much less than what is currently available on the market. “The park will be built in a nature-surrounded location, very close to Quito, and minutes from the international airport, in a beautiful valley east of the Ecuadorian capital,” the company told us. “The wave pool will have a capacity of 672 one-hour sessions per day and will be receiving surfers 14 hours every day. It will offer perfect, 1.80m high waves with 16 seconds duration.” Source: https://wavepoolmag.com/surf-planner-update-the-worlds-latest-wave-pools/",

At the same time, this construction approach ensures the lowering of the entire construction and thus the shutdown of the wave in order to allow the water to flow through the canal as freely as possible when the blackforestwave is idle.\nInnovative</strong>: The system consists of a steel frame construction with lowerable elements, which is based on a hydraulic system. This enables the wave to be continuously adjusted to different water levels. 10 hydraulic cylinders allow alignment of five individual components, the \"waveshaper\" even enables fine adjustment of the wave during surfing. Everything can be regulated with a self-programmed app. The surface of the construction or the ramp, which is necessary for the formation of waves, is clad with wooden planks and screwed to the steel supporting structure. https://youtu.be/iddM61LXU80   \"Die Pforzheimer Surfwelle \"blackforestwave\" wird vom ehrenamtlichen Verein blackforestwave e.V. geplant, gebaut und betrieben.

The local supporters set an example of togetherness when the project almost came to a sudden end due to insufficient funding, which was expected to be paid by the EU. They gathered the missing amount of money by donations from supporters and showed that they would fight for their wave. ​ The location in the tailwater of a hydraulic powerplant sets very good boundary conditions for the construction of a standing wave. It will be 8 m wide and modular adjustable. ​ ​ https://www.facebook.com/surfwelle.wolfratshausen",
