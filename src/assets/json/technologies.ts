    content: "Traditionally wave generating systems in swimming pools use a technique where water is pushed with a pressurized-air system or a paddle.\nFor\nInstead, in high-volume wave pools, a huge volume of water is quickly allowed into the deep end of the pool.The surge in water travels all the way to beach; the water level in the pool balances out again. Since water is fairly heavy, it pushes very hard to find its own level. If you dump more water in, you increase the size and strength of the wave.\nHowever, in high-volume wave pools, a large volume of water is quickly allowed into the far end of the pool, forcing the water to even out, generating a sizeable wave. In these large wave pools, the excess water is removed by being channeled through a return canal where it can be used again to generate another wave.",

    excerpt: "SURFLOCH creates wind by using a combination of vacuum and pressure, known as pneumatics, within custom-designed concrete chambers. An opening at the bottom of each chamber allows the wave energy pulse to be released into open water independently of each other. The controlled variations of the independent pulses can generate an infinite variety of wave swells. Source: https://www.surfloch.com/technology.\nSurfertoday writes:\n\n\"Pneumatic wavemakers are mounted side by side along two walls of large, square tanks,\" the authors point out.\n\n\"They create waves by changing the air pressure beneath a hood so that the water surface there rises and falls.\"\n\n\"As the water surface inside the hood is depressed, the pressure is transmitted, according to Pascal's law, through the water to the water immediately on the other side of the partition where the surface is raised.\"\n\nThat's when the generated disturbance will start to travel across the tank.\n\nBy controlling the amount and duration of air pressure blown by the motor, it is possible to control the amplitude of the waves and the wavelength, respectively.\n\nThe pneumatic wave generating mechanism is similar to the creation of natural waves. The wind blows over the surface of the ocean, creating airpressure drops, causing ripples that will travel and eventually reach the coastline.\n\n The waves at Lochtefeld’s park are created with a combination of supercomputing - some 10 trillion calculations a second - metal chambers and pulses of air.",

    excerpt: "Wave maker\nThe hull drive system is composed of a looped steel rail TRACK onto which the wheeled carriages are attached. Each CARRIAGE is suspended underneath the track, like a carriage on an urban monorail system. By using electric MOTORS to drive the carriages and nitrogen filled rubber tyres on the rails, noise is virtually eliminated. The hull is attached to the carriage by HYDRAULIC actuators which then move each hull to make changes to the wave size and shape. Software controls the speed and the draft and the angle of each hull. Small changes in these three elements, brought about by the software, result in immediate changes to the wave size and shape.",

    excerpt: "According to wavepool magazine: This system is not a wave pool, but a floating wave atoll deployed in lakes, bays and any calm body of water. Based on a spinning motor that directs waves outward along a spiral reef foundation, waves wrap along the spiral for 30-second rides. Max setting produces waves of 6-feet-high and a pier allows spectators to get close to the action. The system generates one wave every 15 seconds. The design is currently being tested in the Aquitaine region of Southwest France at a secret location.\n\nOnce deployed the new aquatic reef will attract sea life including mollusks, fish and anything else that feeds on smaller prey that hangs out on reefs. Although the company insists that while it encourages aquatic diversity, it will also provide a natural barrier to jellyfish and sharks. The wave action has the added bonus of oxygenating stagnant bodies of water. Okahina has a handful of locations in the works, all in France. The first will most likely be near Poitiers, adjacent the Futuroscope theme park.",
